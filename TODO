Todo:
  ☐ Switch to Mobx
  ☐ Redo config file layout
    // What if we use nesting instead of named scenes? Does that give use more
    // flexibility?
    // What if we use x:y coords instead of nested array?  Would that make it
    // easier to read/use?
    ☐ Rename some keys for consistency
      ☐ keyBind -> bindKey
      ☐ sceneSourceToggle -> toggleSource
      ☐ globalSceneSourceToggle -> toggleSceneSource
    ☐ This will make changes to layouts.js -- make sure it comes out clean
    ☐ We want more flexibility on targets and modifiers -- not sure what that looks like yet
  ☐ Redo bootstrap.js
  ☐ Redo obs.js
  ☐ Add handling for multiple zoom levels
    // What does this look like in the config file?
    // Could almost picture holding the momentary button and then having other
    // buttons show up
  ☐ Add handling for writing to a text file (for death counter)
    // How do we reset?  Another button?  Hold the button down for a period of
    // time?
  ☐ Add ability to send commands (events?) to nodecg
