Todo:
  ☐ Switch to Mobx
  ☐ Redo config file layout
    ☐ This will make changes to layouts.js -- make sure it comes out clean
    ☐ We want more flexibility on targets and modifiers -- not sure what that looks like yet
  ☐ Redo bootstrap.js
  ☐ Redo obs.js
  ☐ Add handling for multiple zoom levels
  ☐ Add handling for writing to a text file (for death counter)
